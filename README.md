# Cryptography_Lab5
This lab demonstrates the implementation of the Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange algorithm using Python. The Diffie–Hellman algorithm is one of the fundamental methods used in cryptography to establish a shared secret key between two parties over an insecure communication channel. The algorithm enables both participants, commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, to generate a common secret key without ever transmitting the key itself over the network. This shared secret can then be used for symmetric encryption of future communications, ensuring confidentiality and data security.

In this implementation, two values—a large prime number (P) and its primitive root (G)—are chosen as publicly known parameters. Each participant then selects a private key that remains secret and uses it to compute a corresponding public key using modular exponentiation. After exchanging public keys, both parties compute the shared secret key independently, and due to the mathematical properties of modular arithmetic, both keys turn out to be identical.

The Python code provided here clearly illustrates each step of the key exchange process, including the selection of private keys, calculation of public keys, and generation of the shared secret key. This simple yet powerful example helps in understanding how secure key establishment works in real-world cryptographic systems such as TLS/SSL, VPNs, and other secure communication protocols.
